						While Zzish generally intends to distribute commercial release versions of the Site, Services, and Resources, Zzish reserves the right not to release later commercial release versions of any Beta Release. Without limiting any disclaimer of warranty or other limitation stated in these Terms, you agree that any Beta Release is not considered by Zzish to be suitable for production use, and that it may contain errors affecting its proper operation.

						BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF A BETA RELEASE MAY EXHIBIT SPORADIC DISRUPTIONS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT YOUR USE OF THE SITE IN GENERAL AND ANY SERVICES AND/OR Resources THAT MAY BE OFFERED ON OR THROUGH THE SITE. Zzish, ON ITS BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF THE OTHER Zzish PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW), SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF ANY BETA RELEASE.

						###Fees, Services, Pricing, and Payments

						Zzish does not currently charge any fee to register to open an account for the Services. However, you may be required to pay fees to use certain features or content made available through the Site and Services. We reserve the right in our sole discretion to introduce fees for use of all or any portion(s) of the Site and/or Services at any time. We will notify you if we introduce any new fees or change existing fees. Such notification will take place as specified above in these Terms. However, we will never apply any new or higher fees to you retroactively.

						#####A. Fees

						Teacher-Sellers and Publisher-Sellers who wish to sell their Resources through the Service must register and open an account as a Member.  There is no fee for joining as a Member.

						#####B. Pricing of Resources

						Teacher-Sellers and Publisher-Sellers are solely responsible for setting the prices for the sale of their Resources submitted to and distributed through the Service provided that such pricing (for items that are not offered free of charge) is not below the minimum price set by ZZISH. The minimum price is subject to change; the then-current minimum price will be disclosed each time a Seller uploads a product for sale. Sellers are obligated to sell their Resources at the prices listed on the Service.

						You agree that Zzish may offer Teacher-Buyers discounted purchase plans such as annual memberships and bundles of resources that may include your submission and that Teacher-Buyers may buy your resource at a price lower than your set price unless you choose to opt-out of such discounted purchase plans.

						#####C. Agreement of Teacher-Seller and Publisher-Seller to Pay Service Fees

						In consideration for the services provided by ZZISH, you (Teacher-Seller) agree to pay ZZISH a service fee (“Service Fee”) for all resources you sell to Teacher-Buyers through the Service, in accordance with the following: (i) Members will pay a Service Fee equal to 30% of the sale price of each purchase subject to a minimum of US 30 cents per purchase;
						For each transaction, ZZISH will automatically deduct the Service Fee from the sale price collected from Teacher-Buyers through the Service, and then will distribute the remaining amounts to the Teacher-Seller and Publisher-Seller on a monthly basis as follows: (a) ZZISH will collect payment from Teacher-Buyers at the time a purchase is made through the Service, (b) ZZISH will notify you (the Teacher-Seller or Publisher-Seller) by email of the sale once payment has been verified and collected from the Teacher-Buyer, and (c) provided you are in compliance with these Terms, on a monthly basis, ZZISH will distribute the monies due to you (as a Teacher-Seller or Publisher-Seller) for the sale of your Resources, in accordance with this Section C. If you are in breach of these Terms, for example due to violation of the conduct provisions in Section 6 hereto, ZZISH reserves the right, according to its sole discretion, to withhold any funds that would otherwise be due to you under these Terms, and either keep those funds permanently, or refund them to the Teacher-Buyers who purchased content from you. All monies due to Sellers pursuant to this Section C will be paid to such Sellers as close to 28 days following the last day of the month in which a purchase of your Resources is made (e.g., within 28 days after January 31 for January sales). ZZISH reserves the right to delay payment. Monthly payments will be made through PayPal for all Teacher-Sellers and Publisher-Sellers; ZZISH reserves the right to add, remove or otherwise alter the payment processors used by the Service. If you (as a Teacher-Seller or Publisher-Seller) cannot acquire an account with an approved payment processor, we may consider an alternative form of payment on a case-by-case basis. We make no representation regarding the services provided by our payment processors, and are not responsible for delays in payment caused by them. ZZISH will charge a fee for making each Monthly Payout that is equal to but not more than the cost to ZZISH from its respective payment processors for making the payout. This fee is subject to change at the discretion of the payment processors, and will be taken directly out of your Monthly Payout.

						#####D. Additional Agreements and Obligations of Sellers

						By listing an item for sale, or uploading it to the Service, you (Teacher-Seller or Publisher-Seller) represent and warrant to prospective Teacher-Buyers that you have the right and ability to sell, and that the listing is accurate, current, and complete and is not misleading or otherwise deceptive. You further represent and warrant that the Resources, and use of the same will not infringe any right – including, but not limited to the copyright or trademark right – of any third party.

						If you are a Teacher-Seller or Publisher-Seller of digital Resources, you agree to make at least one sample of such digital Resources available to Teacher-Buyers at no charge at all times when you are offering digital Resources for sale via the Service. When selling digital Resources, you agree that the entire product being sold must be contained within the Resources provided, and that no part of such digital Resources will be delivered separately and require an additional purchase, for example via a third-party website or other channel.

						For any item of Digital Content you upload, you agree to provide your authorization, in the form of the statement below, to Buyers to print and make copies of free and purchased resources.

						"The holder of this receipt is authorized by the owner or creator of the materials listed 
						below, to print and/or make copies of these materials for personal use and/or classroom 
						instruction."

						Additionally, unless otherwise authorized, Sellers agree not to – and agree to cause their affiliates, agents, employees and contractors not to – use or disclose to any third party any order information, or other data or information regarding Teacher-Buyers or any other users of the Service, which is obtained through the Service or disclosed to Sellers by ZZISH in connection with a transaction made via the Service, for any purpose except as necessary to complete transactions made through the Service and otherwise fulfill their obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, for purposes of solicitation, advertising, direct marketing, harassment, invasion of privacy, or any other objectionable conduct).

						#####E. Agreement of Teacher-Buyers to Pay for Purchases

						When you (Teacher-Buyer) purchase original digital Resources you will have the ability to use the materials from your dashboard page for as long as the materials are available through the Service. We may, in our sole discretion, make original digital Resources you purchase available indefinitely, but your access to such materials through your dashboard may be disabled if the material is removed from the Service, for example, by the original seller as a result of the original seller’s account being closed or the Resources being removed in response to an intellectual property complaint or Digital Millennium Copyright Act notification. ZZISH cannot restore access to, or provide copies of, purchased Resources that have been removed from our Service.

						You agree not to share your purchases with your colleagues unless you have purchased additional licenses. You agree not to post your purchased or freely downloaded files on the Internet.

						You agree to pay in full for all Resources purchased through the Service, and agree that ZZISH may charge your credit card, PayPal or other account for any Resources purchased, and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) as may be accrued to or in connection with your Member Account. If you chose to pay via School Purchase Order, you agree that ZZISG may charge your credit card or PayPal account for any Resources purchased, including any applicable shipping charges, and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) as may be accrued to or in connection with your Member Account if the invoice submitted in connection with any School Purchase Order has not been paid within 30 days of the date on which ZZISH invoiced your school.

						YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL SALES PRICES AND FEES, AND FOR PROVIDING ZZISH WITH VALID CREDIT CARD INFORMATION OR PAYPAL ACCOUNT DETAILS FOR PAYMENTS OF ALL SUCH FEES AND CHARGES.

						You agree that delivery of the Resources to you does not transfer to you any commercial or promotion use rights in the Resources. You agree that your use of the Service (including your purchase of Resources) constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to use the Service and such Resources solely in accordance with this Agreement, and that any other use of the Service or Resources may violate copyright and other laws of the United States, other countries, as well as applicable state laws, and you may be subject to liability for such unauthorized use. As a condition of use, you agree not to share your purchases with your colleagues unless you have purchased additional licenses.

						#####F. Electronic Signatures and Contracts

						Your use of the Service includes the ability to enter into agreements and/or to make purchases electronically. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY AND TO PAY FOR SUCH AGREEMENTS AND PURCHASES. YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS APPLIES TO ALL RECORDS RELATING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO ON THIS SITE, INCLUDING NOTICES OF CANCELLATION, POLICIES, CONTRACTS, AND APPLICATIONS. In order to access and retain your electronic records, you may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are your sole responsibility.

						#####G. Limitations

						Your direct interactions (if any) with other visitors to or Members of the Service, including the purchase of, sale of, payment for, and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and that individual. Like with any web-based interaction, we suggest that you use caution and good judgment. You further understand and agree that ZZISH is not involved in any actual transactions made through the Service, and that it is not the agent or representative of any Teacher-Seller, Publisher-Seller, or Teacher-Buyer (or any visitor) for any purpose whatsoever and that it is not responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such dealings or with respect to any other visitor’s or Member’s use or disclosure of your personally identifiable information. For details about our information collection practices, please see our Privacy Policy. IF THERE IS A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND ANY THIRD PARTY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY MEMBER OR VISITOR OF THE SERVICE), ZZISH IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO BECOME INVOLVED, AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE ZZISH FROM ANY CLAIMS, DEMANDS, OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND AND OF ANY NATURE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY SUCH DISPUTE. You agree that you are solely and exclusively responsible for any federal, state, or local taxes, including sales taxes, that might apply to any sales you make in connection with Service.

						#####H. Refund Policy

						All sales are final, and no refunds are available.

						ZZISH may in its sole discretion make certain exceptions to this policy on a case-by-case basis, for example if: (a) a digital resource is defective; or (b) a product description is materially deceptive or misleading. If such an exception is made, ZZISH may issue to the buyer a refund for such purchase in any manner it deems appropriate, including without limitation in the form of store credit.

						As a buyer, it is your responsibility to determine that you have the appropriate hardware/software to make use of your purchases, and that the content you are purchasing is legal and noninfringing. No refunds are available in these cases. Products removed from the Service due to a complaint of copyright/trademark infringement, or for any other reason, are not eligible for a refund.

						If ZZISH elects to issue a refund to a buyer, the amount refunded will be deducted from the seller’s next Monthly Payout, provided however that if the seller’s next Monthly Payout is less than the refund amount(s), ZZISH may charge such refund amount(s) to the seller’s credit card, PayPal account, or other payment processor account.

						###Submissions

						You are responsible for the information, opinions, messages, comments, photos, videos, graphics, sounds, lessons, educational Resources and other content that you submit, upload, post, send, or otherwise make available on or through the Site and Services (each a "Submission"). You may not upload, post, send or otherwise make available on this Site or through the Services, any material protected by copyright, trademark or any other intellectual property or other proprietary right without the express permission of the owner of such copyright, trademark or other intellectual property or other proprietary right, and the burden of determining whether any material is protected by any such right is on you.

						You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, damages, and any other monies owing to any person and/or entity by reason of any Submissions posted by you to or through this Site and the Services. Without limiting the foregoing, you shall be solely liable for any and all claims, damage, and loss resulting from any infringement and/or misappropriation of copyrights, trademarks, and/or other proprietary rights, violation of contract, privacy or publicity rights or any other harm resulting from any Submission that you make. You have full responsibility for each Submission you make, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness. Without limiting the foregoing, you are only permitted to make Submissions that are consistent with the educational purposes for which Zzish makes the Site and Services available.

						Zzish's guiding philosophy is to promote education for children as broadly as possible. Accordingly, to the extent you provide Submissions that consist of lessons or other educational content, we encourage you to place such content in the public domain so that anyone may use it. Unless otherwise explicitly stated herein or in Zzish Privacy Policy, you agree that any Submission provided by you in connection with these Services is provided on a non-confidential basis. You hereby grant to Zzish a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable  (except as expressly set forth in this Agreement), royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works of, publish, transmit, distribute, and otherwise use each of your Submissions, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, and authorize others to use the Submissions.   IF YOU CHOOSE TO CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP AND LEAVE THE SERVICE, AND/OR HAVE REMOVED YOUR RESOURCES FROM THE SERVICE, THIS LICENSE WILL BE DEEMED REVOKED AT THE TIME THAT YOU CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP AND/OR REMOVE ALL SUCH RESOURCES, HOWEVER ZZISH LICENSE TO MAKE RESOURCES YOU HAVE SOLD PRIOR TO CANCELLATION OF YOUR MEMBERSHIP AND/OR REMOVAL OF SUCH CONTENT AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS WHO HAVE PURCHASED SUCH MATERIAL PRIOR TO CANCELLATION OF YOUR MEMBERSHIP AND/OR REMOVAL OF SUCH CONTENT SHALL SURVIVE CANCELLATION OF YOUR MEMBERSHIP AND/OR REMOVAL OF SUCH CONTENT.

						We may modify or adapt your Submissions in order to transmit, display, or distribute them over computer networks, in various media, and/or make changes to the Submissions as necessary to conform and adapt them to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services, or media and/or otherwise modify them in any manner in our sole discretion. Zzish does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any Submissions.

						For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that you retain ownership of your Submissions; provided however, that Zzish may use such Submissions in accordance with the foregoing license. By way of example only, Zzish may use any lesson (or any modification and/or derivative work thereof) submitted by a user through the Services for Zzish's benefit, without any fee, royalty, other payment, or attribution due to the submitting user; provided, however, that the submitting user may not compel any such use.

						When you provide Submissions you agree that those Submissions shall not be in violation of the "Unauthorized Activities" paragraph below. THOSE PROHIBITIONS DO NOT REQUIRE ZZISH TO MONITOR, POLICE OR REMOVE ANY SUBMISSIONS OR OTHER INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY YOU OR ANY OTHER USER.

						###Ratings

						Zzish may in its sole discretion, enable users to provide feedback and/or ratings concerning lessons and other Resources that they have used through the Services or otherwise. Such feedback and ratings are intended to enable users to evaluate the usefulness of such Resources. Please use caution and good judgment when providing feedback or ratings, as they will be viewable by other users of the Services. All feedback and ratings that you provide through the feedback and ratings features will constitute Submissions. Without limiting the foregoing, you may not: (i) post any false, malicious, reckless, abusive, defamatory, offensive, inflammatory, or inappropriate information about any lesson or other Resources; (ii) disclose any personally identifiable information or other confidential information of any user or other person using the feedback and ratings tool; (iii) manipulate feedback and ratings, including, without limitation, by rating your Submissions; or (iv) provide feedback or ratings on unrelated Resources.
