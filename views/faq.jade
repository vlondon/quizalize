					li
						p#quickplay
							strong What is the difference between “Quick Play” and “Log in with Zzish”?
						p
						|Quick Play
						p
						|When a student logs in by entering a name and class code, the student is treated as a temporary user. 
						|Their student will show up in your teacher dashboard, but the student data will be deleted after 24 hours. 
						|Quick play is useful as students don’t need to remember usernames or passwords.  
						p
						|Log in with Zzish
						p
						|If you want to record student data over time, then your students need a student Zzish account. 
						|This is so that we know the student is the same student each time they use Quizalize. 
						|It’s easy to create student Zzish accounts.Students who have email addresses can simply go 
						|to www.zzish.com and create a student Zzish account by entering their email address and 
						|choosing a password.  If your students don’t have email addresses you can create a username and 
						|password for each of them quickly using the teacher dashboard in the Zzish Learning Hub.
					li
						p#zzishhub
							strong What is the Zzish Learning Hub?
						p
						|The Zzish Learning Hub is a universal dashboard for education applications and can be accessed 
						|by going to www.zzish.com.   The Learning Hub lets teachers and students collect data from many 
						|different applications in one central place and provides a single consistent dashboard for all 
						|the applications they use.   The Zzish Learning Hub also provides a universal login for education 
						|applications, similar to a Facebook login.  Students and teachers can log into different learning 
						|applications using the same login credentials.   At present only a few applications plug into the 
						|Learning Hub, but our goal is to have every education application plugged in in due course.
